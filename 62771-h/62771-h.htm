  <h2 class='c006'>SALLY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>If you take a short-horned cow, a
limping calf, a few sheep, a swarm
of fowls, a pig with a litter of eight,
and an everyday lazy kind of horse,
you have John Dobbin’s well-stocked
farm.</p>

<p class='c008'>One morning John woke up at five,
bustled round the hen coop, gave an
extra feed to the pigs, milked the cow,
fed the limping calf, and then went
into the stables.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Sally, old girl,” he said,
making some fuss as he fed his old
mare, “just keep your eye on things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a bit. I’m goin’ round to Farmer
Peckett. He’s in bed, bad with rheumatism,
an’ I shan’t be back afore
dinner.” So saying he took the halter
from Sally’s neck, and let her roam
about at will.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sally left to herself felt glumpy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now where’s the master gone off
this morning,” thought she. “Farmer
Peckett. I know no Farmer Peckett.
It’s very queer his leaving us all alone.
Something might go wrong while he’s
away, and he can see to things a lot
better than me. Just look! There’s
that calf a limping among the lettuces.
And that knock-kneed hen with her
chirrupy brood scratching the carrots up
as if she was seeking to-morrow. I do
believe those bees mean to swarm, and no
master here. I’ve watched him swarm ’em
many a time, but I couldn’t manage it.”</p>

<p><i>Hen with her Chirrupy Brood.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“If you’re not off about your business,
you old gimmer,” as a long-nosed
sheep looked through the hedge—“I’ll,
I’ll— Now what do you want?” called
out Sally, turning from the patient ewe
to a fat, wheezy donkey coming up the
garden path. “What brings you here
this morning, Neddy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He-haw!” said Neddy, rolling his
tongue round and round, and giving a
three-cornered look out of his left eye.
“Thought I’d just see how you were
getting on, Sal! But you do look
prime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just be off about your business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg your pardon, my lady. But
if you have no objections I’ll just march
myself off into the stable. I know
Farmer Dobbin supplies you with good
fodder.” And away went Neddy “he-hawing”
for all he was worth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>frightening the chicks out of their poor
little senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Sally was looking after him,
and marvelling at his cool impertinence,
up came a tinker. “Pans to mend,
kettles to mend, scraps of old iron,”
he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, Sally!” he called out cheerfully
to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He-haw!” bellowed Neddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s John Dobbin? Are ye
carryin’ on the farm by yourself, Sally?
Well, you’re a fine steed to place in
front of any man’s castle! I’ll speak a
word for ye when I see the general
again. He’s sure to be wanting a new
charger to carry him off to the wars
soon. But I see you’re figgity, Sally,
so I’ll bid you good-day. Pans to
mend! Kettles to mend! Scraps of old
iron!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Mercy on us!” wailed the frightened
creature, the perspiration dropping from
her nose end. “How thankful I am to
think he’s gone! If he’d walked into
the kitchen, and master out, he’d have
smoked up all his new baccy. When
will it be twelve o’clock? Oh, but I
don’t like looking after things. I will
be glad when master comes home.”
Because she felt relieved of anxiety a
warm feeling spread all over Sally, and
her poor old heart felt happy. Even
Neddy’s ugly “he-hawing” failed to
rouse her ire. So she fell to trotting
about the garden in a silly kind of
way. While Sally was frisking about
in a happy-go-lucky fashion, up came
a sailor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morning,” he said, “fine time o’
year this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sally looked sad.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
<img src='images/i_011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“No one at home, eh? Where’s
John Dobbin? Hasn’t left any message,
eh! Stand out of the way and I’ll go
into the house, and sit down till John
comes. Bravo! my beauty,” stroking the
limping calf, “you’re a fine mixed lot
of customers I can see. Master John
will be at the market I’ll be bound.
It’s twenty year since John and me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>met. Won’t we have a fine time of it
now. I hear he’s never married, n’more
have I. Wait till he comes in, we’ll
be spinning yarns till bed-time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All this time Sally was pawing at
the cobbles with her hoof. “Well,
you’re a cool hand to be sure,” thought
she. “And he’s helping himself to my
master’s baccy. Well, if that doesn’t
beat all. I’ve got him in the kitchen
at any rate, and if he isn’t quite quiet,
he looks honest. I’d best be off and
see how Neddy’s getting on, for he’s
a first-class scamp if you like.” And
away she trotted, seeing on the road
that the bees were hard at work, for
you will understand how this lazy old
horse was most particular that everyone
else but herself should be working.
She did not like to see anything idle.
If you notice, animals that have lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>a long time with people learn to know
their ways. And it may sound funny
to you children, but I have often seen
animals try and imitate their owners.
So if any of you have a pet you must
be careful and behave kindly before it,
for then, at least, you will be setting
a good example. And I would advise
you to have nothing to do with a boy
whose dog fears him, or with a girl
who is not kind to her dollies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, where is Neddy?” said the
weary mare, “for not a speck of him
can I find. There’s every bit of fodder
munched up—rakes and spades kicked
about—yes, he’s been here sure enough.
And there’s the brand new bucket
stamped on. Whatever will Master say?
This is keeping an eye on things till
master comes back, isn’t it! Oh! dear
me. I’ve got a run-a-gate donkey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>somewhere and a Jack Tar in the
kitchen smoking my master’s baccy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bow-wow-wow!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter now?” As
Sally turned round she saw a sheep
dog. “Oh? Ben, it’s you,” she cried.
“I’m nearly worried out of my wits.
For goodness’ sake do stop here, Ben,
and keep guard till master comes back.
There’s the bow-legged toppin’d hen
wants keeping in her place, and that
limping calf ought to be tethered. And
Neddy ought to be sent home instead
of stamping the fodder about and
kicking the new bucket, and—there’s
that sailor chap in the kitchen smoking
my master’s baccy! Mercy on us! what’s
that?” as a band struck up a gay tune.
“It’s a travelling circus—no, it isn’t.
My word, the whole village is up and
our sailor gentleman is dancing a hornpipe!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Thank goodness—there’s master
coming! Whoever would have thought
of things happening like this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What cheer, John!” cried the
sailor, extending his hand and running
forward to meet his old friend. “How
are ye, my hearty? What, don’t you
know me, John? My old chum! Why,
I’m Sam—surely!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can’t be, but it is!” and the
farmer’s voice became husky. “I’ve
thought ye dead this many a year. So
you’ve actually returned, Sammy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To settle in the old country, and
to pitch my tent alongside o’ yours,
John.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, you sailor man,” cried
Sally, “master belongs to me. We run
this farm between us, we do, and we
want no hornpipy sailor to join us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where does this band come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>from?” asked the farmer. The musicians,
let me say, were trumpeting and drumming
for all they were worth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I brought it with me from
Jarmouth. Look here, my hearties,”
he called out, “change the tune to
‘Auld lang Syne’ and we will all
join in the chorus.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Which everybody did. Even Neddy
sat on his haunches and “he-hawed” his
loudest, of course, lolling his tongue
round as usual, and throwing three-cornered
glances in all directions. The
limping calf was touched and was
suddenly seized with a racing fit; and
the chickens, no doubt thinking that the
end of the world had come, turned
somersaults and fought battles in all
directions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Sally groaned aloud. “Ah!
this is the end of everything,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>said. “I’ve cared for, and worked for
master for many a year, and now
what between the sailor, the band, the
chickens, the bees and Neddy—well!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I think the whole stock has taken
leave of their senses,” said Farmer
John. “Why, Sally, lass,” he said,
looking upon his woe-begone horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and patting her on the shoulder, “do
you think, old girl, that I have forgotten
thee? No, no! Now, my good
people,” flinging a coin to the musicians,
“I thank you for your music, and
good-day to ye. Don’t you see that
you are frightening my animals. Neighbours,”
he cried, addressing the crowd,
“good-day to ye also, and Sam, my
man—quick march into the house.
Adieu!” he cried to the departing
crowd. “This sort of thing don’t
quite suit country folk—now do it,
Sally?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And as he led the horse by the
halter he whispered in her ear: “Now
you needn’t go and be jealous, old
girl. Sam shan’t put your nose out.
You’ve been a good old servant to
me, and you’re missis here, so keep
your temper.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Sally stamped her feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says he’s come to retire with
you, master,” she began, only John
had walked away. “And oh!” winnied
Sally, only John did not hear her,
“after I’ve been missis ever so long,
it’s hard to be supplanted by a hornpipy
sailor!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“Have bought a first-class mount,”
read out the vicar, from a telegram
which he had just received.
“There,” he said to his wife, “it’s done
now—so Towser will have to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, part with Towser? Poor old
Towser,” spoke up Mrs. Dene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s so slow, and I have been
indulgent too long already. Now, don’t
make a fuss, my dear. I daresay you
have grown fond of him, and so you
will be of the new horse when it
comes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That settled it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next morning soon after breakfast,
the groom led a fine spirited mount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>up to the hall door. Up jumped the
vicar from his seat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Lucy Lu! Now are you not
pleased with my new purchase?” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are sure that horse is quiet,
John?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read the warranty.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“He doesn’t look steady like dear
old Towser.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please don’t bracket them together.
They are two entirely different animals.
This new horse is well bred, and but
six years old; while Towser has not
many good points and is aged.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t send Towser away—now
will you, John? for I’m sure this
new horse will not suit. He’s got such
a wicked eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, what silly things you
say. I can see you don’t like my
new purchase, and I do,” said the vicar,
emphatically.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>“Morning, Hopkins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morning, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, this appears to be a grand
creature,” stroking the mane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir,” said the groom.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I somehow fancied Grahame would
choose well. He has a splendid head.
Fine bone. Stands well. Splendid flank—got
many good points, I notice—he’s
not quite as sedate looking as our
old pony.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed he’s not, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we shall see. I’ll take him
for a ride.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And as his master rode away, “He’s
a real bad’un that little horse is,” said
Hopkins. “A reg’lar bad’un. Bought
at a grand Repository, and quiet and
sound, warranty says—a real varmint,”
says I.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now as Lele was stepping along,
would it not be as well to tell you
something of him, children? To begin
with, he had been sold several times,
changed masters more than once for
something worse than disobedience. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>was up to all kinds of tricks, could
buck, kick, jib, in fact he could perform
all manner of naughty tricks—yes, do
all except do as he was bid.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he looked this way and that,
snorted, gave a bit of a jerk, just to
rouse his new master, and than sighed.
“Well, it’s come to a nice thing now,”
he grunted, “me—a well-set-up sprightly
hunter, knocked down at a sale for thirty
pounds! Sold to an old parson. Humph!
I’ve seen lots of parsons in the hunting
field, but never thought I’d like to live
with one. Now I know I shan’t. Wish
I hadn’t thrown Lord Jim. Bless me!
Changed my walk in life entirely, and
however I shall take to being a goody-goody
horse I don’t know. Suppose I
shall have to eat second-rate oats till
I grow old and wheezy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman who was riding along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the road stopped to speak to the
vicar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hallo!” said Lele to the stranger’s
mare. “How do! Fine morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very,” said the sedate little grey
mare.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Not much doing here. Slow sort
of place I should say, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what you mean? Have
you just come to this neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Came last night. Slow train. Block
in the line. A miserable journey.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Do you think you will like the
neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! you rude creature, I shan’t
talk to you any more! Where do you
come from, and whatever is the vicar
doing with you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lele took no notice. Presently he
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does nobody hunt here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hunt? My master doesn’t, but
people he knows do. I’m sure your
master doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lele groaned. “Well, however I’m
going to suit goodness knows. I shall
die of yawning and rust out before a
month is over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As I was saying,” said the vicar
to his friend, “I think he is a perfect
little horse. He is quiet, as you see,
and I’m not likely to kill him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>work. I just go my usual round, but
I do like a well-bred horse. He’ll
have a very easy time of it with me.”
Lele groaned louder than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have not stiff hills in this
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lele grew restive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And life is much the same all the
year round.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall I bolt?” fumed Lele.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ride for an hour in the mor—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, I can’t stand this.
In all the homes I’ve had there’s been
something to do. There’s been steeplechasing
in Spring—hunting—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the hounds are out,” called
Mr. Dobson. He was riding a little
way in front and could see over the
hedge. “See! there’s the whip making
for Cranstone Hill! Is he used to
following the hounds?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“I don’t know—he does appear
restive. Whoa-a then!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you hunt, Mr. Grey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, but I haven’t indulged
in such things for years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’d better get off—I wouldn’t
trust that horse.” But the vicar had
no time to get off, and another thing
he did not mean to. He meant to
stop on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s my opinion my master is not
so simple as he looks,” thought Lele.
“He’s been used to spurs he has. What
a dig he did give me then. I shall
have to try to unsettle him—for he is
rather a heavy load to carry, and I
mean to follow the hounds—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tally ho!” rang out in the clear
morning air as Lele bucked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vicar stuck on.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shied.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>His master didn’t care.</p>

<p class='c008'>He jibbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he might have exploded if he
liked, nothing short of an earthquake
would have disturbed the vicar.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I say, hold hard there,” yelled
Mr. Dobson, “he’ll kill you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he won’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d better get off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not if I know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t, then, eh!” struck in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Lele—“then here goes—” And, like a
flash, over the hedge he went—in short,
I may tell you he had galloped a field
over, cleared a gate, forded a stream,
broken through a copse, and then, Tally
ho! he was with the hounds, close
alongside the whip, and in a few
minutes stood with his master, who was
perspiring and mopping his face with
his handkerchief, abashed at the attention
his presence called forth, and stammering
his thanks to the master of the hounds
who handed him the brush.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Allow me to congratulate you,
good sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, just look here,” interrupted
Lele—only nobody noticed him—“that
brush belongs to me. I followed the
hounds, and as I couldn’t throw the
vicar off, of course I had to bring
him—much against his will—a fact, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>assure you. Just stick that brush behind
my ear, please. Why, Kiddy, is
that you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lily!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goodness me! Wonders will never
cease, I own a vicar now—you know
I was bundled off to a Repository after
I had thrown Lord Jim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he is, sir! Here he comes
riding that limping crocodile of a nag—don’t
think he is benefited by the
change—do you, Lele?” But before Lele
could answer Lord Jim had discovered
his late horse. He made up to the
vicar as they were going home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excuse me, sir,” he began, and
then, “allow me to congratulate you on
your horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, another!” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“I have just sold him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That accounts for my possession—fact
is I have just bought him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then it all came out—Lord Jim
repented parting with Lele, and although
the good vicar said nothing, he thought,
“Well, he’s certainly a bargain, but
my parish will miss me if, every time I
want a little trot out, my horse takes
it into his head to follow the hounds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And how it came about I cannot
tell you, children, but before the vicar
got home he decided to let Lord Jim
have his favourite back again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I repented it directly after. But
you do look so stupid being thrown in
the hunting field—it was the first time,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The vicar nodded—and Mrs. Grey
chuckled when he came home, safe but
very much shaken.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“He’s far too much for you, John.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my dear, you are right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Towser?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall remain.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“And Lele?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Again belongs to Lord Jim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was a clear walk over that,”
mused Lele as he crunched the well-grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>oats in Lord Jim’s stables that
night. “I never met my match till his
reverence mounted me—I might have
behaved ugly, but I’m pleased to think
I didn’t throw the old gentleman.
There’s ever so many runs in prospect,
you say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Five,” said Biddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’m entered for next Spring
steeplechases, so Tally ho! But I know—I’ll
never throw Lord Jim again!”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SIMON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Simon lay on the grass, thinking.
He flicked a fly that was tickling.
Although he was a most worthy horse,
he was often troubled with very grand
notions about himself and very poor
thoughts concerning his neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Day had not yet begun at Tower
Tighe Farm. The stars had faded away,
and the great warm sun was waking up
the nestlings, waking them up to cry
for food, and disturb folk generally,
for everything was very quiet and still
at Tower Tighe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The owner, John Fairfax, was a
spare man, very thin, with a grey straggly
beard, and bright blue eyes. He possessed
fierce-looking brows, and a very
long nose. His wife was a fat little
lady, who bustled about a great deal,
and went round the farm saying kind
things to everybody, and to Tony the
fox-terrier in particular, for Tony was
a thorough little scamp. He told old
Simon one day, that missis was a deary,
and behaved fine when she wasn’t walking.
Then she was just like a lop-sided
hour glass, so fat all round—save at
the waist, which was thin, and she
wobbled like a tee-totum.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SIMON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“If everything and everybody would
only wake up,” moaned Simon, chafing
at the stillness about him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wake up. Arn’t I here,” called
Spangles, the Rooster, as he proclaimed
to the world “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad to hear you say so,”
snapped Simon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Top of the morning to you, sir,”
said Spangles. “Don’t get crabby with
your neighbours. Hi! there,” he called
out, as he saw Tony racing after
a rabbit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind that nimble scratcher,”
neighed Simon. “Come here and I will
tell you something. I am going to the
Mill—are you ready to join me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Simon mentioned “Mill,” Tony
stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Rats live there,” he said to himself,
“rats.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can talk,” said Simon, seriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed,” said the sagacious dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when they were on the high
road bound for the Mill, Simon began:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tony, I’ve been considering.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a decent little fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tony blinked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been bothering about this a
long time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never thought you bothered about
anything. You’re such a quiet old
chap, Si. But hurry up! Do! There’s
a shrew waltzing along the road, and
I’m getting impatient. Do be quick;
I can’t go marching by your side in
this procession-like fashion for ever and
a day, now can I?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
<img src='images/i_039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” began Simon, which told of
an ache at his heart, “Master Harry’s
coming home. He’s been away for years
and years. He was one of the liveliest
lads you’d meet in a day’s march. But
he had one big fault. When he wasn’t
romping he was learning lessons. And
how those lessons did spoil him, they
took all the fun out of him. Master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>says they put sense into his head, but
what does anyone want with sense,
answer me that? and you know it isn’t
proper for a lively lad to be thoughtful.
Well, as I was saying, he was a
fine sturdy chap was Master Harry—that’s
years before you were born,
nipper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Humph!” said Tony.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now he is coming home, at
least he has written a letter to say so.
He says that he has grown rich, and
has been to foreign places, and is
bringing a horse and a dog—you hear
that Tony, a horse and a dog.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Simon said this so seriously that
Tony looked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m the only horse here, and you
are the only dog here, and Tower Tighe
is but a small farm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A regular scrap of a place.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Well, it appears to me that our
whole life will be changed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will be jollier for both of us,
if you mean that,” said Tony. “There
will be a friend for you and a companion
for me, for if you just ask
yourself, Simon, we ain’t—er—quite companions,
now are we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re such a featherhead, how
could you expect to be a what-d’ye-say
to me. You never could think of
things in the right way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah! you’re always repining, and I
think life’s far too scrappy to waste it
in grumbling. When you take growing-up
time off—teething, distemper, and
lots of things come to you whether
you want ’em or you don’t; then there’s
meal times, sleeping, and sometimes you
have to take physic—O! my, life’s very
short, when you take off all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>things. Just see what a glorious morning
it is! Whoop, there! I see a rat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And off trotted Tony in full pursuit
of a rodent which had made for his
hole, leaving the little dog to fume and
fret and bark himself hoarse all to no
purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Tony to a nicety. There
never was such a scamp in this world.
But he’s a good-tempered little creature
for all that. He’s so nice and frisky.
I try, but I suppose I’m growing old.
Now, if I was to try to be unselfish
and funny, I wonder how I’d feel—Bah!
but I will!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now as the cart was laden Farmer
John sprang up, and the horse that
started pulling him was Simon certainly,
but what a changed creature was he.
He fairly charged the hills instead of
crawling up them, and then he took
the high road as if he had springs in
his hoofs, and his dinner was awaiting
him at home.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Why, Giles,” said the farmer on
nearing home, “what’s all this fuss
about? Why is the garden gate open,
and why is all this fuss going on here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, young Mr. Harry’s come home!
Oh! master, master, an’ he’s growed a
man, and he’s that big an’ strong an’
grand, he’d make two of me, master!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” said the farmer, springing
from his seat. “Well, I’m blest—Hal?
Why, old Simon, you must have smelt
him—for I’ve never seen you skip up
the road like that. Oh! Hal! Hal! my
lad—why, you are a man indeed! My
bonny lad—” as a stalwart fellow came
forward to greet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Father!” cried his son, and the two
men clasped hands.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Presently the old man spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s thee, it’s thee, Harry!”
and tears crept into the farmer’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>You see it was ten years since Harry
Fairfax had left home, a stripling, and
now he had returned a sunburnt hearty
man with a strong mellow voice, and
eyes that were bright and merry and kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hasn’t he grown big, father?” said
Mrs. Fairfax, mopping her eyes with a
big roller towel she was busy folding
when her son arrived. Then she flicked
a stray bit of down which had blown
upon his coat sleeve, flicked it away,
and stroked the arm with a proud feeling
of possession. “Do come into the house,
Harry dear, and get a rest while I see
to a bit of dinner. Father, I do believe
this is the happiest day of my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just wait till I bait Blackie, mother,”
said her son, “I’ll be with you in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>minute, but I want to attend to my
beauty first. Ah! she’s a grand little
lady, mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just the same as you always
were, Hal, somebody first and yourself
afterwards. What a famous little
mount she is though! Wherever did you
pick her up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In Texas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, she is a dear little mare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is a thorough little Arab. I
broke her in myself, and it’s one of my
best investments, father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here Blackie thought fit to express
her thanks to her master for his kind
remarks about her, and Farmer Fairfax
stepped aside to allow her to show off
her capers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a second stall in the stable,
Harry,” said his father. “Bring her
along; my boy; Simon will be very
pleased to have a bright little friend
like Blackie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At first he was shy, fearfully shy,
for he was not used to being stared
at, and Blackie had such beautiful eyes
which opened in wonder at the ungainly
specimen before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-day, sir,” she began, “I
suppose I am to share this place
with you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, ye—s,” stammered Simon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pleasant country this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Been here a long time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Always.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a rusty old creature he is,”
Blackie was thinking. “I believe he’s
blushing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did she come from?” thought
Simon. Presently he stammered:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Do you like o—a—t—s?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But before the answer was given
Tony and Pat came tumbling in, breathless
with running.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you feel at home now,
Pat?” said the little terrier.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stunnin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you like your quarters? I
say, Pat, you’re the best fellow I ever

Burney, and already many of the ponies
had left the sands to earn a winter
living with the farmers round about.
“Or do odd jobs,” Jenkins said, anything,

again, and they might go back to Burney

<p class='c008'>“Bed indeed! A cast iron bed
wouldn’t hold the lads I have to carry—wobbly
imps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we shall have to say good-bye,
Bob. By the way, where do you
put up in the winter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I suppose I shall have to
earn my living with Carrots. You see,
I carry a boy, an only son, who lives
near the moors, to school every morning.
Then I bring him back at nights. He
lives on the moors and sometimes a stiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>time we have of it, what between
blizzards and frosts, and snowdrifts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you get some fun?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, now and again we do. Carrots
is brimful of mischief when lessons are
over. I help him a bit now and then
myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our poor old master doesn’t look
merry,” remarked Snowie, after a while.
“He’s not been well this summer. His
limbs are getting stiff; I’m afraid it’s been
but a poor season for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here they are, sir,” said Jenkins,
walking towards the ponies. “As fine
a pair as you would wish to see.
They’re good-tempered little creatures,
and thorough game. Rising seven, clean
limbs, wind and eyesight, and right
sorry I’m to part with ’em. They’re
the best couple I ever had. That’s
a fact. And if my health hadn’t broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>down, and I’m giving up the business,
nothing in the world would have made
me sell ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re certainly a fine couple,”
said the gentleman, patting first one of
them and then the other. He was
evidently impressed, for presently he
said, “If your price is all right, I am
sure they’ll suit my boy and girl.” And
do you know it only took a few minutes
to settle the bargain?</p>

<p class='c008'>You could see that old Jenkins was
pleased, the way he clinked the gold
before dropping it into his bag. “I
feel sure you’ll be good to ’em, sir,”
he said, as the gentleman was walking
away. “It’s been a quick, satisfactory
bargain, but I knows you’ll not regret
it.” And before Snowie had got over
the fright—for she had been listening
with all the ears she had got—and Bob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>had realised what
had taken place, old
Jenkins had tossed
off his coat, and
was grooming them
down in a spluttering,
whistly wheezing
way, and muttering
away to himself
something in this
manner:</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Shoo! Snowie,
my lass, come, yer
going to leave yer
old master and live with quality now.
I know ye’ll behave yerself. It’s Bob
what’s botherin’ me.” Here he began
towselling the brown pony. “Mind when
yer gets to yer new sitewation ye behave
yerself, yer little varmint. No monkey
tricks there, my man. No sly ways.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>You’ve both worked well for me, and
I’ve done the best I can for yer both.
I’ve sold yer to Squire Morton, and
given yer first-class characters. So
don’t go and disgrace yer old master—good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And that was the way old Jenkins
dismissed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were taken to the station,
bundled into a horse van, and presently
arrived at Humshaugh, a quiet little
countrified station, where a red-faced
porter helped them out of the van,
then gave them in charge of a groom
who had come to meet them. “Why,
Bob,” he cried on sighting the little
brown pony, “whoever would have
thought of seeing you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s David, ’pon my word it is,” cried
Bob, stamping his feet and swishing his
tail round and round like a windmill.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SNOWIE AND BOB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“You seem to know the pony,” said
the porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we have met before. It’s
funny that the Squire should pick up
Bob of all ponies in the world. So
this little white creature is Snowie I
suppose?” Snowie blinked hard. She
was too shy to answer “Yes.” It was
such a big social leap for her to take
jumping direct from Burney Sands to
Humshaugh Park that it took all her
breath away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob,” she ventured, as they were
trotting along the road, “do you think
we shall like the change?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is my mane straight?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what our old master is
going to retire on. I hope he has
plenty to keep him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will see I shall get new shoes
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Bob, are you listening to what I
am saying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have oats for dinner, corn for
breakfast, beans for supper, and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! he’s quite stupid,” sighed
Snowie, “pride has completely turned
his head.” Then she heaved a very big
sigh. Bob took no notice of that. Suddenly
he cried, “You must forget you
ever ply’d for hire on Burney Sands,
Snowie. Never, never remind me of
it. You’re to mix with quality now,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the way, that groom knew
you, Bob.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather, I shouldn’t have known
him though. He was in the stable
where I was born. You understand?
I always told you that I belonged to
quality folks, Snowie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Snowie heaved another big sigh. “His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>head is completely turned,” she said.
“Bob can’t stand prosperity. I shall
have to keep my eye on him, I know
I shall.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>They had reached the Hall at last,
and were taken round to the stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bob took it all in at a glance.
“Snowie,” he said, in an awed voice,
“Snowie, we’re going to retire here.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Presently the sound of children’s voices
burst upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! David, you have brought the
ponies. Father, they have come. We
have been looking for you for an hour
at least. What beauties! Which is for
me, father?” cried Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And me, father,” cried Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The brown pony is for you, my
child, and Lawrence is to have the white
one. So you like them, my dears?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like them? Oh, we love them,
father! Wherever did you find such
treasures? Thanks, thanks, a thousand
times thanks, you dear kind father.”
And the children threw their arms
around his neck and kissed him again
most heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There now, that is all right,” said
Squire Morton, putting his collar straight.
“Now mount. Never mind a saddle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>David shall come and show your
mother how you can ride your new
possessions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And leaping upon their backs Lawrence
and Betty trotted away, using
the primitive reins that hung loosely
round their ponies’ necks, and behaving
like experienced equestrians.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See, mother, what a lovely little
creature mine is,” cried Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And mine,” cried Lawrence. “She
is as white as milk and her name is
Snowie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How pleased the children are, John,”
said their mother, “you could not have
found a more suitable birthday gift.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Whereat the Squire laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just have a ride about the park,
children, and then let David lead them
away. It is tea-time now, and to-morrow
morning you must both be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>up early and have a canter before
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards when they were together
in the stable and were made comfortable
for the night, “Snowie,” said Bob,
“before I go to sleep I should like
t’fess. I told you a big fib as we were
coming along from the station.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” said the sedate little mare,
looking much shocked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I did. It was such a sudden
change. And things have fashioned themselves
so funnily I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand,” said Snowie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You remember, David?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The groom here, yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said he was groom in the stables
where I was born.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I said a very big fib.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“David knew me when I trundled a
rag and bone cart along the streets of
London in company with my first owner,
Mistress Sally Brimstone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Bob. Rag and bone cart.
Sally Brimstone? I can’t understand
it!” cried Snowie, aghast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“No, but I can. Old Sally sold me
to old Jenkins for thirty shillings.
That’s where I came from, Snowie.
Fact!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“But you always told me you were
gently reared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid I always told you fibs.
Now I’m going to turn over a new
leaf in this new situation. From henceforth
I shall speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I were you I would just hold
my tongue and from henceforth say
nothing at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so let us leave them, children.</p>
